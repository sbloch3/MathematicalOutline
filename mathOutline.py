#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = "your" + "name"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 + 4
print(x)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 - 4
print(x)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = .25 - .25
print(x)


#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 * 4
print(x)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
stringVar = "dogs are cool"
x = 5
print (stringVar + x)


#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 / 4
print(x)


#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = .25 / .25
print(x)


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 % 4
print(x)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 // 4
print(x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 ** 4
print(x)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
a =
